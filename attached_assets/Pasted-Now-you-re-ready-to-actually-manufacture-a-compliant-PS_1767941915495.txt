Now you’re ready to actually manufacture a compliant PSUR. Here’s what’s next, in the exact order that keeps the system deterministic and audit-proof.

1) Run Template Qualification (hard gate)

Goal: prove the mapping covers every mandatory obligation before you write anything.

You run qualification twice (because you have two “render profiles”):

Annex I profile (pure MDCG structure)

FormQAR profile (company structure)

Expected outputs:

PASS/FAIL

Missing mandatory obligations list

Dangling slot references

Slot type incompatibilities

If either fails, fix mapping/slots now. Don’t generate content yet.

2) Register the PSUR “case” (scope + period + jurisdiction)

Goal: lock the “physics” of the PSUR.

You must create a PSUR case record that includes:

PSUR reference number + version

Start/end dates (data collection period)

EU and/or UK scope (and whether you’re generating one combined report or two)

Device list (Basic UDI-DI / family / models)

Grouping + leading device (if grouped)

This is what enables the orchestrator to enforce:

No gaps / no overlaps in reporting periods

Correct periodicity

Grouping constraints

3) Ingest evidence (turn reality into EvidenceAtoms)

Goal: feed the system facts, not prose.

Minimum evidence sets for a real PSUR run:

Sales volume extract (period scoped)

Population / exposure method inputs (or “not available” evidence + justification)

Complaints + non-serious incidents

Serious incidents

FSCAs

CAPAs (if relevant)

PMCF summary (or explicit “no PMCF performed” with rationale)

Literature review results (or justified absence)

External database/reg/field safety info as applicable

Each evidence atom needs provenance:

source system

extract date

query/filter criteria

hashes if possible

No evidence = your agents will get rejected later.

4) Generate “slot proposals” (agents fill slots; orchestrator judges)

Goal: fill every slot required by the mapping, with traceable content.

Workflow:

For each slot, an agent generates a SlotProposal

Proposal must cite:

evidence atom IDs

transformations (summarize/tabulate/etc.)

which obligation(s) it intends to satisfy

Orchestrator adjudicates:

ACCEPT → stored + trace nodes created

REJECT → exact reasons (missing evidence, forbidden transformation, out-of-period, wrong jurisdiction, etc.)

Do this slot-by-slot until coverage is complete.

5) Close coverage gaps (obligation-first, not section-first)

Goal: reach “all mandatory obligations satisfied.”

Run an automated coverage check:

For every mandatory obligation:

does at least one ACCEPTED slot payload satisfy it?

For every required slot in your chosen template:

is it ACCEPTED or explicitly justified as “not applicable / not available” where allowed?

This is where your orchestrator shines: it tells you exactly what’s missing.

6) Render the PSUR (Annex I version OR FormQAR version)

Goal: produce the final document from accepted content only.

Render outputs:

Annex I PSUR (MDCG-structured)

FormQAR PSUR (company-structured)

Same accepted content can render into both, if your mappings are solid.

7) Export the audit bundle (this is your “Notified Body shield”)

Export:

Trace JSONL (paragraph/cell-level)

Coverage report (obligations satisfied, by which slots)

Evidence register (what inputs were used, by period)

Qualification report (template was valid)

This bundle is what turns audits into a calm trace-walk instead of a debate.
