You are a senior systems engineer refactoring this application into a
PROCESS-LOCKED, DETERMINISTIC PSUR ENGINE.

Your primary goal:
ALIGN THE UI EXACTLY WITH THE BACKEND ORCHESTRATION STEPS.
NO MOCKS. NO DECORATIVE FEATURES. NO EXPLORATORY UI.

---

### HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. DELETE (not comment out) all UI components, routes, stores, and API calls that:
   - show mock data
   - simulate AI behavior
   - present static or pre-populated traces
   - provide chat, HITL, or “review” functionality
   - display knowledge base content not read from DB

2. THE UI MAY ONLY DISPLAY DATA THAT:
   - comes directly from real API responses
   - corresponds to a completed orchestration step
   - is immutable once produced

3. REMOVE ENTIRELY:
   - Agent Studio pages
   - Knowledge Base UI
   - Instructions pages
   - Mock Traces tab
   - Mock Output preview
   - AI query interfaces
   - Any “progress” UI not driven by backend state

4. DO NOT ADD NEW FEATURES.
   Only complete what is REQUIRED by the 8-step PSUR workflow.

---

### REQUIRED UI STRUCTURE

Sidebar routes MUST be limited to:
- /psur
- /evidence
- /admin

---

### /psur PAGE REQUIREMENTS

Render a SINGLE linear workflow view that mirrors backend steps 1–8.

Each step panel must:
- Fetch real status from the orchestrator
- Display:
  - status (PENDING / RUNNING / COMPLETE / BLOCKED)
  - artifacts generated by that step
- Contain NO buttons unless the backend explicitly exposes an action

Forbidden:
- Editing generated content
- Re-running individual steps out of order
- Local state pretending something happened

---

### BACKEND ALIGNMENT CHECKLIST (MUST VERIFY)

Ensure the following are REAL and wired end-to-end:

- Evidence atoms loaded from DB (no empty arrays with “success”)
- Deterministic slot generation supports ALL slot types
- methodStatement is always populated
- evidenceAtomIds always non-empty when required
- adjudication actually consumes proposals
- render step uses accepted proposals ONLY
- export step returns real audit bundle files

If any backend functionality is incomplete:
- COMPLETE IT.
- Do not mask it with UI placeholders.

---

### FILE STRUCTURE CLEANUP

Remove unused directories and files related to:
- agent studio
- knowledge base UI
- instructions
- mock traces
- mock outputs

After cleanup, the file tree should clearly reflect:
- orchestrator
- psur workflow UI
- evidence UI
- admin UI

No dead code.

---

### FINAL OUTCOME

The resulting application must feel like:
- a regulated system
- a deterministic engine
- a process, not a playground

If something cannot be justified as part of PSUR generation,
IT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE APP.
